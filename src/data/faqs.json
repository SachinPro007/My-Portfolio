    "question": "What technologies do you specialize in?",
    "answer": "I specialize in crafting modern UIs with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Material UI. For state and data handling, I use Redux Toolkit, React Router, Axios, and TanStack Query. I also design intuitive interfaces with Figma and add sleek animations using Framer Motion. Additionally, I’m skilled in Git version control and GitHub collaboration for team projects and open-source contributions."

  {
    "question": "What kind of projects have you built?",
    "answer": "Over time, I’ve built several projects—from small practice apps to more detailed interfaces—while sharpening my skills. For my portfolio, I’ve chosen to highlight the three that best represent my work:\n\nMy personal Portfolio, with custom color choices for the user.\n\nA full-featured eCommerce frontend.\n\nAn Employee Task Management App with role-based dashboards.\n\nI'm also currently developing a new project with Next.js and TypeScript. These projects are more polished and closer to real-world use, and they reflect my focus on responsive design, clean UI, and solid frontend logic."

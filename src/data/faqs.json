    "question": "What technologies do you specialize in?",
    "answer": "I specialize in the modern Next.js ecosystem with full-stack capabilities, building high-performance applications using TypeScript, React, and the MERN stack. My core expertise includes Next.js with App Router, TypeScript for type safety, TanStack Query for server state management, Redux Toolkit for global state, and Tailwind CSS with Material UI/Shadcn for responsive UI development."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of projects have you built?",
    "answer": "I've built production-grade full-stack applications including a Secure Todo Application with custom authentication and MySQL integration, a performance-optimized Portfolio with custom theming, and ShopEase E-Commerce with advanced features like debounced search and real-time cart synchronization. I'm currently developing a comprehensive MERN application with Next.js and TypeScript."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you have experience with state management?",
    "answer": "Yes, I have comprehensive state management experience. I use Redux Toolkit for complex global state and TanStack Query for efficient server state management, caching, and data fetching. I've implemented state solutions that reduced API calls by 40% while maintaining data integrity in eCommerce applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are your projects mobile responsive?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! I follow mobile-first responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and Shadcn components. All my projects guarantee seamless experiences across all devices while maintaining 90+ Lighthouse performance scores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Have you used animation in your projects?",
    "answer": "Yes, I extensively use Framer Motion to create engaging, performance-optimized animations. My portfolio features custom scroll effects, hover reveals, and smooth transitions crafted from scratch to enhance user experience without compromising performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure code quality in your projects?",
    "answer": "I implement professional code quality pipelines using ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged for automated pre-commit checks. This CI/CD-ready approach ensures consistent, maintainable code standards and prevents quality regressions in production applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you have full-stack development experience?",
    "answer": "Yes, I have full-stack MERN experience with Next.js. I've built secure applications with custom authentication systems using Auth.js, Google OAuth, and implemented security measures like HMAC verification, Bcrypt hashing, and JWT tokens. I'm proficient with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js in the Next.js ecosystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you handle API development and validation?",
    "answer": "I use Next.js Server Actions and Route Handlers for API development, with comprehensive validation using Zod for both API and form validation. I implement intelligent access control through Next.js Middleware and maintain proper environment separation for production-grade applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's your approach to authentication and security?",
    "answer": "I implement robust authentication systems including custom cookie-based sessions with HMAC verification, Bcrypt for password hashing, and OAuth integrations. I focus on user data isolation and security best practices, ensuring tamper-proof session management in production applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you optimize application performance?",
    "answer": "I optimize performance through TanStack Query caching strategies, code splitting, and efficient state management. My eCommerce project achieved 90+ Lighthouse scores and sub-second load times by reducing API calls by 40% through intelligent caching and debounced search implementations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you work with databases?",
    "answer": "Yes, I have experience with both MongoDB in the MERN stack and external MySQL databases. I've implemented proper data modeling, relationships, and efficient querying patterns in my full-stack applications, ensuring data integrity and performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are you currently learning or improving?",
    "answer": "I'm continuously advancing my knowledge in Next.js App Router patterns, performance engineering, and advanced full-stack architecture. I'm currently developing a comprehensive MERN application with production-grade workflows and exploring advanced security implementations and scalable application patterns."

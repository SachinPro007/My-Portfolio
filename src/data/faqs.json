  {
    "question": "What technologies do you specialize in?",
    "answer": "I specialize in the modern Next.js ecosystem, building full-stack, serverless applications. My expertise is in TypeScript, Next.js (App Router), and real-time backends with Convex. I also have deep experience with the MERN stack. For the frontend, I use TanStack Query, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS/Shadcn."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of projects have you built?",
    "answer": "I've built several production-grade applications, including 'Ezensi,' an AI-Native Blog Platform using Next.js, Convex, and Google's GenAI SDKs. I've also built a secure Next.js full-stack application with custom authentication and MySQL, and the 'ShopEase' eCommerce UI with advanced caching (TanStack Query)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you have experience with state management?",
    "answer": "Yes, I have comprehensive state management experience. I use Redux Toolkit for complex global state and TanStack Query for efficient server state management, caching, and data fetching. I've implemented state solutions that reduced API calls by 40% while maintaining data integrity in eCommerce applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are your projects mobile responsive?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! I follow mobile-first responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and Shadcn components. All my projects guarantee seamless experiences across all devices while maintaining 90+ Lighthouse performance scores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Have you used animation in your projects?",
    "answer": "Yes, I extensively use Framer Motion to create engaging, performance-optimized animations. My portfolio features custom scroll effects, hover reveals, and smooth transitions crafted from scratch to enhance user experience without compromising performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure code quality in your projects?",
    "answer": "I implement professional code quality pipelines using ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged for automated pre-commit checks. This CI/CD-ready approach ensures consistent, maintainable code standards and prevents quality regressions in production applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you have full-stack development experience?",
    "answer": "Yes, I have extensive full-stack experience. I build modern serverless backends with Convex and also have a deep understanding of the traditional MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js). My security expertise includes managed auth with Clerk as well as custom systems using Auth.js, Bcrypt, and JWTs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you handle API development and validation?",
    "answer": "I use Next.js Server Actions and Route Handlers for API development, with comprehensive validation using Zod for both API and form validation. I implement intelligent access control through Next.js Middleware and maintain proper environment separation for production-grade applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's your approach to authentication and security?",
    "answer": "I use a professional, layered approach. For rapid, enterprise-grade security, I integrate modern solutions like Clerk. I also have deep experience building custom, tamper-proof systems from scratch, including cookie-based sessions with HMAC verification and Bcrypt hashing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you optimize application performance?",
    "answer": "I optimize performance through TanStack Query caching strategies, code splitting, and efficient state management. My eCommerce project achieved 90+ Lighthouse scores and sub-second load times by reducing API calls by 40% through intelligent caching and debounced search implementations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you work with databases?",
    "answer": "Yes, I have experience with both MongoDB in the MERN stack and external MySQL databases. I've implemented proper data modeling, relationships, and efficient querying patterns in my full-stack applications, ensuring data integrity and performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are you currently learning or improving?",
    "answer": "I'm continuously advancing my knowledge in Next.js App Router patterns, performance engineering, and advanced full-stack architecture. I'm currently developing a comprehensive MERN application with production-grade workflows and exploring advanced security implementations and scalable application patterns."
